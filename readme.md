## üöÄ Usage

Run this command in the **root** of your Next.js project:

```bash
npx @dropinblog/nextjs-rendered-starter-kit
```

You‚Äôll be asked a few interactive questions:

1. **Is your Next.js project using the `src/` folder?**

   - If **yes**, `/blog` and `/dib-lib` will be added to `src/app` and `src/dib-lib`.
   - If **no**, they will be added to `app` and `dib-lib` in your project root.

2. **Do you want to install DropInBlog dependencies now?**
   - If you confirm, the CLI automatically installs the required packages using your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm).
